<strong>galley</strong> <em>(n.)</em>
13c., "sea&shy;going ves&shy;sel ha&shy;ving both sails and oars," from Old French ga&shy;lie,
ga&shy;lee "boat, war&shy;ship, gal&shy;ley," from Medi&shy;eval Latin ga&shy;lea or
Ca&shy;ta&shy;lan ga&shy;lea, from Late Greek ga&shy;lea, of un&shy;known ori&shy;gin. The word has
made its way into most Wes&shy;tern Eu&shy;ro&shy;pe&shy;an lan&shy;gua&shy;ges.
Ori&shy;gi&shy;nal&shy;ly "low, flat-built sea&shy;going ves&shy;sel of one deck," once a
com&shy;mon type in the Me&shy;di&shy;ter&shy;ra&shy;ne&shy;an. Mean&shy;ing "cook&shy;ing range or
cook&shy;ing room on a ship" dates from 1750. The prin&shy;t&shy;ing sense of gal&shy;ley,
"ob&shy;long tray that holds the type once set," is from 1650s, from French ga&shy;l√©e in the same
sense, in re&shy;f&shy;er&shy;en&shy;ce to the shape of the tray. As a short form of galley-proof it
is at&shy;tes&shy;ted from 1890.</galley><div style="border:1px solid red; width: 10mm; height: 10mm;">X</div>
